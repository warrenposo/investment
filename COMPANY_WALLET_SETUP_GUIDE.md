# 🏢 Company Wallet Integration Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Overview:**
This system now uses **your company's wallet addresses** as the receiving addresses for all user deposits, while still tracking individual user balances in the system. This is the professional way to handle cryptocurrency payments.

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

### **Payment Flow:**
1. **User requests deposit** (e.g., $100 via Bitcoin)
2. **System calculates crypto amount** (e.g., 0.0022 BTC at current price)
3. **User gets YOUR company Bitcoin address** to send payment to
4. **System generates unique reference** (e.g., VC1703123456ABC123)
5. **User sends crypto** to your company address with reference
6. **System tracks payment** and updates user's balance when confirmed
7. **You receive the crypto** in your company wallet
