# SPA Routing Fix - 404 Error on Refresh

## Problem
When refreshing pages like `/signin`, `/dashboard`, etc., you get a 404 error. This is because the server tries to find these paths as actual files, but they only exist in the client-side router.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Development (Vite Dev Server)
✅ **Fixed in `vite.config.ts`**
- Added `historyApiFallback: true` to the server config
- This tells Vite to always serve `index.html` for any route

**To test:**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/signin and refresh - it should work!

---

### 2. Production Deployment

Configuration files have been created for various hosting platforms:

#### **Vercel** ✅
File: `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Netlify** ✅
File: `netlify.toml`
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

#### **Static Hosting (Netlify, Render, etc.)** ✅
File: `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

#### **Apache Server** ✅
File: `public/.htaccess`
```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

## How It Works

### Before Fix:
1. User visits `/signin` → Works (client-side routing)
2. User refreshes page → Browser requests `/signin` from server
3. Server looks for `/signin` file → Not found
4. Server returns **404 error** ❌

### After Fix:
1. User visits `/signin` → Works (client-side routing)
2. User refreshes page → Browser requests `/signin` from server
3. Server redirects to `/index.html`
4. React Router takes over and shows `/signin` page ✅

---

## Testing

### Test in Development:
1. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
2. Navigate to any route: http://localhost:8080/signin
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. Page should load without 404 error ✅

### Test in Production:
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Preview the build: `npm run preview`
3. Navigate to any route
4. Refresh the page
5. Should work without 404 error ✅

## Deployment-Specific Instructions

### Deploying to Vercel:
```bash
# vercel.json is already configured
vercel deploy
```

### Deploying to Netlify:
```bash
# netlify.toml and _redirects are already configured
netlify deploy
```

### Deploying to Apache Server:
1. Upload all files including `public/.htaccess`
2. Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled on your Apache server
3. Your routes should work after refresh

### Deploying to Nginx:
Add this to your nginx configuration:
```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Deploying to Firebase Hosting:
Add to `firebase.json`:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Mobile Testing

### On Mobile Browser:
1. Open your app on mobile device
2. Navigate to any page (e.g., /signin)
3. Pull down to refresh the page
4. Should load without 404 error ✅

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting 404 in development?
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear the cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
3. Restart: `npm run dev`

### Still getting 404 in production?
1. Verify the correct config file exists for your hosting platform
2. Check if the file is included in the build output
3. Check hosting platform documentation for SPA routing

### Working locally but not on mobile?
- This is likely a hosting configuration issue
- Verify you've deployed with the correct config file
- Check your hosting platform's deployment logs

## Files Created/Modified

✅ Modified: `vite.config.ts` - Added history API fallback
✅ Created: `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
✅ Created: `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment config
✅ Created: `public/_redirects` - Static hosting config
✅ Created: `public/.htaccess` - Apache server config

## Why This Happens

Single Page Applications (SPAs) use client-side routing. All routes are handled by JavaScript in the browser. When you refresh a page:

1. **Client-side routing** (React Router) doesn't run yet
2. Browser makes a **server request** for that path
3. Server needs to be configured to **always return index.html**
4. Once index.html loads, React Router takes over and shows the correct page

This is standard behavior for all SPAs (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).

---

## Additional Notes

- These configurations are safe and won't break existing functionality
- All API calls and static assets will still work normally
- This is the recommended approach for all React Router applications
- The fix works for both HashRouter and BrowserRouter (you're using BrowserRouter)

---

## Support

If you still experience issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify hosting platform supports SPA routing
3. Check if custom domain DNS is properly configured
4. Ensure all configuration files are deployed
